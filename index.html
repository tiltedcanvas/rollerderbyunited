        <h1>United</h1>
        <p>a fundraiser by ToRD skaters, for all of roller derby.</p>

            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>We hope you're doing well and staying healthy through this pandemic. As you may know, a lot of roller derby leagues have been hit hard by COVID-19. With bouts and event-based fundraisers canceled for the foreseeable future, and with some in our community no longer able to pay dues (especially while practices are canceled indefinitely), so many leagues are hurting. Now, more than ever, our community needs to come together and lift each other up - we are all in this together, and we can make a difference through the strong community we've built!</p>
            <p>Roller derby has been a safe space, an affirming space, a source of entertainment, and a lifeline for so many people. Now is the time to give back (if you can!!) and help make sure roller derby leagues remain open and operational in a post-COVID world. Keep scrolling for how you can contribute, and how to apply if you are a struggling league.</p>

            <h2>Contribute to the Fundraiser</h2>
            <p>As part of this fundraiser, we are selling rad t-shirts ($25 each plus shipping) and collecting donations. All proceeds from t-shirt sales and 100% of donations will be put into a relief fund, to be split among struggling leagues. The goal of this fund is to make up for revenue lost due to COVID-19, and help leagues stay open and operational post-pandemic. Everyone who purchases a t-shirt or donates will additionally be e-mailed a PDF of the cutest roller derby colouring pages. Feel free to print at home, and colour in while practicing social distancing!</p>
            <p>In addition to financial contributions, posting and sharing this fundraiser on your social media would be hugely beneficial. We encourage you to share our website link far and wide, post your filled in colouring pages, and talk to your friends/family about this fundraiser—the more money we raise, the more leagues we can help and the more meaningful a contribution we can distribute. Feel free to use our fundraising hashtags when posting: #RollerDerbyUnited #TheNewEngagementZone</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="frequentQuestion">Why are leagues struggling with finances at this time?</p>
                    <p class="frequentAnswer">Roller derby bouts and money raising events have been cancelled across the board - and with some league members unable to pay dues (especially given practice cancellation), this means less (and sometimes no) money coming in. At the same time, costs continue to add up: rent, insurance fees, bout/travel contracts that can’t be refunded, merch that was already purchased but can’t be sold, general upkeep costs associated with running a business, etc. This is putting a lot of financial pressure on leagues, especially when many do not have significant reserves to draw from

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="frequentQuestion">Which leagues are struggling?</p>
                    <p class="frequentAnswer">We’ve heard about many leagues struggling from this, and have reached out to every WFTDA league in Canada and invited them to apply for this fundraiser. We will remain transparent around the number of leagues who have applied, and will update this section as we get more information</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="frequentQuestion">How is Toronto Roller Derby benefiting from this fundraiser?</p>
                    <p class="frequentAnswer">Our league is struggling to pay rent and other bills at this time. However, since we knew that other leagues are in a similar position, we wanted to create a fundraiser that benefited the roller derby community as a whole - not just ToRD. ToRD will be submitting an application the same way that other leagues will be able to, and the committee that reviews them, will also review ours and determine what we are eligible for.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="frequentQuestion">Who determines where the money is going, and what is the process for determining eligibility?</p>
                    <p class="frequentAnswer">We have formed a Roller Derby United committee that will read through all applications and determine what leagues receive funds, and the amount each receives. This will be largely based on need, with our primary goal ensuring leagues can remain operational post-COVID and our secondary goal easing COVID-related financial stress. Are you interested in helping with this fundraiser? Send an email to rollerderbyunited@torontorollerderby.com </p>

                <li>
                    <p class="frequentQuestion">What amount of money from the t-shirts is going to leagues?</p>
                    <p class="frequentAnswer">100% of donations, and 100% of t-shirt proceeds are going into the relief fund, to be split among struggling leagues. It is difficult to say what this means in terms of $ per t-shirt, since our costs vary significantly based on volume sold</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="frequentQuestion">What will you do if you raise money in excess of what is needed?</p>
                    <p class="frequentAnswer">If we raise money above what is needed by participating leagues, we will donate the excess funds to COVID relief funds such as <a href="https://www.gladdaylit.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glad Day’s Emergency Survival Fund</a>. We will remain transparent around funds raised by updating this website intermittently (but because our t-shirt costs vary significantly based on volume sold, totals are estimates)

                <li>
                    <p class="frequentQuestion">Where are you sourcing the t-shirts, and how is that organization dealing with COVID-19?</p>
                    <p class="frequentAnswer">We are sourcing t-shirts from a small Canadian business located in Quebec, <a href="https://www.printeez.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Printeez</a>. The owner is at the shop, printing t-shirts (alone) and other employees are working from home.</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="frequentQuestion">What if I want to order t-shirts in bulk?</p>
                    <p class="frequentAnswer">If you are interested in ordering t-shirts in bulk, please email us at rollerderbyunited@torontorollerderby.com. We can consult with Printeez and see what we can do for you in terms of shipping cost.

            <h2>Current Status</h2>
            <p>To date, we have raised ~$1,400 in t-shirt proceeds and donations—huge thanks to all who contributed! Right now two leagues have applied for funding in addition to Toronto Roller Derby (so, a total of three applications)—and it’s looking like our fundraising goal will likely exceed $15,000.</p>
